# MCLA
  The MorseCode Learning Academy (MCLA) is a website dedicated to teaching students with learning disabilities(LD) vocabulary, and basic reading skills, using gamification and Morse Code. I realized that there is a need for technology that focuses on the characteristics of learning disabilities. Which include but not limited to:
 
 •	Short Term memory
 •	Letter recognition
 •	Short attention
 •	Executive function processing 
As a Special education teacher, I have used various instructional technology software’s that help leaning but very few were inclusive of LD. This software aims to close that gap one game at a time. 

Primary role: 
  •	Creator
  •	UX/UI designer and developer of website and both game applications, 

Primary Software used: 
  •	Unity
     o	C# 
  • JavaScript 
  •	Python Machine Learning A.I
  •	 MySQL
  •	Travis
  •	Heroku
  •	Express
